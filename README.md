# Eat-Da-Burger

#### Created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Node and MySQL was used to query and route data to the app, and Handlebars was used to generate HTML.

#### Doesn't quite work... but here is the local host where it shows some functionality... https://github.com/davidtillack/Eat-Da-Burger/blob/master/localhostPic.png
